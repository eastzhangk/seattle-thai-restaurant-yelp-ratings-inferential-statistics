# seattle-thai-restaurant-yelp-ratings-inferential-statistics
Just having some fun. Ate at a new Thai restaurant, Aroy Mak Thai Food (yum!), on 5/18/2025 and now it's in my list of top 3 Thai restaurants in the Seattle metroplex. Decided to evaluate Yelp ratings through some classic inferential statistics.

List (in random order):
1. Aroy Mak Thai Food
2. Isarn Thai Soul Kitchen
3. Fern Thai on Main

Down the line...
Look at recent reviews?
Scrape data for more restaurants?
Sentiment analysis?
